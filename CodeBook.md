#Overview
Hi! Welcome to the codebook.

According to the Project, this is what we're supposed to describe here:

*"...variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data..." *

Probably best to explain how machine learning works from a data preparation standpoint. Data are separated into features, also known as (independent, sometimes) variables, and outcomes, also known as labels, also known as (dependent) variables, depending upon your context. 

Each subject, a list of identities of which can be found in the subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt files within their respective directories for train and test, did a bunch of activities, which were listed in the activities_labels.txt file. This activity served as the outcome of interest. Thus, the y\_train and y_test files listed an integer for each run, and these integers referred to the associated acitivty from the activities_labels file.



#Variables

Variables were taken from the UCI repository. The Features_Info file in the directory "Explanations from UCI" offers a nice overview, offering more depth than the ReadMe from their.
